I2C Multiplexer Hub Sor Sensor Reading and Device Control

This is a hub for reading data from sensors with the same address or controlling devices with the same address. The inital creation was to read multiple sensors with the same I2C address. After exploring the possibilities, I was able to use the same structure as TCP/IP to use the multiplexer as a 'sub-net' of sorts
